write short note for the fs module In this example, greet is added to Person.prototype. When person1.greet() is called, JavaScript first looks for greet on person1. Since it's not found there, it then looks at person1's [[Prototype]], which points to Person.prototype. It finds greet there and executes it. The this keyword inside greet refers to the specific person1 object, allowing for object-specific behavior even though the method is defined only once on the prototype.
